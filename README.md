# Jeepers

Jeeepers is a capstone project that was built during my time at Nashville Software School. Jeepers is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js.

Jeepers is designed as an on-line marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and trade off-road vehicles.
